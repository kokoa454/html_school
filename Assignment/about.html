        <h4>I am a Japanese student aspiring to be a Software Developer!</h4>
        <p>Since elemetary school, I have been interested in Information Technology, such as building computers, installing Linux OS to super old Windows PCs, setting Network and searching about its Security. Also, I have always loved to think about the logic of things(e.g., human emotions and machine mechanisms).
          <br>Currently, I would like to become someone who can develop technology that utilizes IoT, which is used by everyone, such as in automobiles or home appliances.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Why Russian language...?</h5>
        <p>Because I graduated a brach school of the Far Eastern Federal University(Дальневосточный Федеральный Университет) in Hokkaido. At the moment, I study at a technical colledge and my current speciality is IT, but previously I studied Russian regionology and Russian language.</p>
